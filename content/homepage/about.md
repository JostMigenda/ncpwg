## Introduction
Originally posted at the [Council for Publishing Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/news/vision-more-trans-inclusive-publishing-world)

Transgender, non-binary, and/or gender diverse—here shortened to “trans”—authors seeking to receive full credit for their work face unique challenges and risks. Trans people do not receive the same legal protections against discrimination as cisgender people worldwide; they are subject to significant risk of discrimination, harassment, and violence; and many experience a particular form of personal trauma connected to their pre-transition identities that makes them especially vulnerable within the academic community. One significant source of epistemic labor, risk, and trauma for transgender authors, is the continued circulation of their previous name. In this article, we present five high level principles for trans-inclusive name changes in academic publishing and consider the implications of such a paradigm shift within the scholarly world.

Some of these suggestions may be more or less difficult to implement, but there is critical and practical value in clearly articulating our values and ideals for a more just and inclusive publishing environment. 

## Five guiding principles and best practices

### 1. Accessibility
Name changes should be available to authors upon request without legal documentation, unnecessary barriers, burdens, or labor placed upon the author making the request.

### 2. Comprehensiveness
Name changes should remove all instances of an author's previous name from the records maintained and disseminated by the publisher.

### 3. Invisibility
Name changes should not draw attention to the gender identity of an author, nor create a clear juxtaposition between the current name and the previous name.

### 4. Expediency and simplicity
Name changes should be implemented in a timely manner, and with a minimum of bureaucratic overhead.

### 5. Recurrence and maintenance
Publishers should regularly audit and correct new instances of changed names in order to prevent ongoing dissemination of incorrect information
